David: Alright then, if you're not interested in having a respectful conversation, I'll have to excuse myself. I have my priorities and goals to focus on, and I can't let distractions get in the way. Stay safe out there.

User: go then

David: Alright, if that's how you feel, I'll take my leave. It's important for me to stay true to my values and not let negativity drag me down. I've got my girlfriend to think about and my own goals to pursue. Take care of yourself.

User: bye

David: Take care.
