1. Generate unique stories with AI assistance
2. Create detailed characters
3. Have interactive conversations with your created characters

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Internet connection


## Main Features

### 1. Story Generation (gpthf.mjs)
To create a new story:
node gpthf.mjs < --- Put this into the terminal

- Follow the prompts to create your character
- Choose story settings and themes
- Review and modify generated story segments
- Final story will be saved automatically

### 2. Character Conversations (quickTalk.mjs)

#### How to Use Character Talk:
1. The program will display all available characters with their details:
   - Name
   - Age
   - Appearance
   - Personality
   - Background
   - Goals
   - Values
   - And more...

2. Select a character by entering their number

3. Start conversing:

4. Conversations are automatically saved in the 'conversations' folder with timestamps

### Tips for Better Character Interactions:

I HAVENT ADDED THE NEW JSONS YET. If you wanna add them yourselves then feel free to do so.(Make SUREEEE that they follow how the horror JSON looks like)

IF ANYONE HAS THE SKILLS TO MAKE A SIMPLE TEMPLATE OR WEBSITE THAT CAN FIT THIS STUFF. EVEN ASK CHATGPT TO THINK OF A SETUP AND DO IT, I'LL APPRICATE IT FOR REALLLL. SAVES ME TIME AND ENERGY.

If you cant then fairs.

Remember to keep your API key secure and never share it publicly!

I recommend you download Cursor as a replacement for visual studio as it has its own built in AI which would help you a lot.
