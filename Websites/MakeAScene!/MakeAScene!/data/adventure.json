            "characterArc1": "1. The Professional\nThis is a character who's fundamentally adventuring because they're good at fighting. They could be a mercenary, a gladiator, a bounty hunter, or a duty-bound champion; regardless, fighting is the name of their game. Typically, they seek wealth, fame, or glory - but they may have other backstory hooks based on the other archetypes they embody.",

            "characterArc2": "2. The Haunted\nThis is a character whose backstory is dominated by a single momentous (often traumatic) event in their lives. Examples include watching their home burn down, escaping a shipwreck, or gazing into the maw of an aberrant beast just before it swallowed a city. Nine times out of ten, this involves some dead parents.",

            "characterArc3": "3. The Runaway\nAs the name suggests, this character is running away from the big event in their backstory. A Fighter guilty of murdering an innocent man, a Monk who escaped a shadowy order, or a noble forced into hiding - a runaway's motivation is defined by the thing they're trying to avoid while they adventure.",

            "characterArc4": "4. The Amnesiac\nA pretty obvious one; this is a character who has lost their memories or simply doesn't know their origins. Often, but not always, they want to get those memories back (see Seeker).",

            "characterArc5": "5. The Chosen\nA character who has been selected, either by magic or by society, to bear a particular responsibility. Sometimes, the character embraces the mantle; other times, they become a Runaway. Regardless, this role represents something more than the character themselves; it's a symbol, an ideal, or a curse that must be faced.",

            "characterArc6": "6. The Faithful\nThis character is motivated by a devotion to their art.",

            "characterArc7": "7. The Inquisitive\nThis character wants to know everything. It might be about a particular domain of expertise, of course, but it might also be everything. Whether hungry for book knowledge or for ferreting out secrets, this character lives and dies by information.",

            "characterArc8": "8. The Stranger\nThe stranger is foreign to the central location for one reason or another. They may be a traveler from a foreign country, a planar refugee, or a Captain-America-esque Man Out of Time. Regardless, this backstory choice often has a huge effect on roleplay as this character learns to deal with the customs of the world around them."

        "storyExcerpts": "Walter Scott's recognition of the supreme delightfulness of Gil Blas has not been general among the critics; indeed, the sense of its intrinsic value as a definition of life must rather be placed to the credit of the uncritical public. Voltaire, referring to Lesage in his 'Siecle de Louis XIV,' limits his praise to the remark: 'His novel Gil Blas has survived because of the naturalness of the style.' The curtness and inadequacy of this remark are probably due rather to the fact that Voltaire did not see beyond the superficial traits of this novel, its general picaresque atmosphere, than, as has so often been asserted, to any malicious intent to decry a book in which he supposed himself to have been held up to ridicule. [The traditional view is, however, plausible enough, as Mr. James Fitzmaurice-Kelly has shown in his introduction to the edition of Gil Blas published in the 'World's Classics.' There can be no doubt as to Lesage having ridiculed Voltaire in two of his plays.] Joubert, whose delicacy was a hothouse fruit grown in the thin subsoil and the devitalized air in which he was compelled to live, corroborates Voltaire, while revealing his own prejudices -- after all, is not the main interest of criticism the light it throws upon the critic? -- in a characteristic utterance: 'Lesage's novels would appear to have been written in a cafe by a domino-player, after spending the evening at the play.'"
