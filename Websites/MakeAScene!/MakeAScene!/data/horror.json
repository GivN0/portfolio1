    "finalGirl": "The \"Final Girl\" archetype is a cornerstone of horror movie characters. She is typically the last woman standing, confronting the antagonist and surviving to recount her harrowing tale. The Final Girl is resourceful, intelligent, and often embodies moral purity. She is distinct from her peers, typically abstaining from the reckless behavior that leads to their demise. This character often undergoes significant development, evolving from a seemingly ordinary individual to a courageous survivor.",
    
    "monsterVillain": "The Monster/Villain is a pivotal archetype in horror movies, serving as the primary antagonist who drives the plot's conflict. These characters come in various forms, from supernatural creatures to deranged humans, embodying the genre's intrinsic fears. Monsters can be supernatural, such as ghosts, vampires, and werewolves who pose existential threats, often exploring themes of the unknown. These can also be human monsters, such as serial killers and psychopaths who reflect real-world fears, grounded in psychological horror. Lastly, mythical creatures like urban legends and ancient beasts offer a blend of historical and fantastical horror.",
    
    "skeptic": "The Skeptic archetype is a character who doubts or denies the presence of supernatural or malevolent forces, creating additional tension and dramatic irony within the narrative. Skeptics are typically rational, logical, and often possess a scientific or academic background. They cling to reason and empirical evidence, refusing to accept the inexplicable until undeniable proof forces their hand. An example is Dr. Seaton in Poltergeist III, whose denial adds layers of tension.",
    
    "nonbeliever": "The Nonbeliever fiercely denies the reality of the horror elements until it's often too late, contrasting sharply with the Skeptic. Nonbelievers exhibit stubbornness and often maintain their disbelief until faced with undeniable proof, usually leading to fatal consequences. This character underscores themes of ignorance and acknowledgment.",
    
    "reluctantHero": "The Reluctant Hero finds themselves thrust into confrontation against their will, often adding layers of depth and intrigue to the story. Reluctant Heroes typically face internal conflicts, moral dilemmas, and hesitations. They're often ordinary individuals who must overcome their fears and doubts to rise to the occasion. For instance, in Logan, the protagonist's struggle with his violent past underscores his reluctant nature.",
    
    "comicRelief": "The Comic Relief provides crucial moments of humor that balance the tension in horror movies, making the terror more palatable for the audience. In *Us*, Gabe Wilson's humor occasionally shifts the audience's focus, illustrating both the power and risk of comic relief. Conversely, Rod Williams in *Get Out* effectively balances humor and horror, enriching the narrative without undermining the tension.",
    
    "innocentVictim": "The Innocent Victim archetype amplifies the emotional stakes within a horror narrative. The Innocent Victim often represents naivety and purity, making their predicament particularly heart-wrenching for the audience. Innocent Victims are usually portrayed as naive, kind-hearted, and morally upright. They often stand in stark contrast to the malevolence surrounding them, making their misfortune even more poignant. They might be children, young adults, or otherwise \"innocent\" individuals who become ensnared in horrifying scenarios.",
    
    "sympatheticVillain": "The Sympathetic Villain complicates the traditional hero-villain dynamic by evoking empathy. Their motives, often grounded in understandable or relatable grievances, make them multidimensional. Sympathetic Villains possess a backstory that humanizes them. Their actions, while villainous, are driven by motives that can elicit sympathy or understanding from the audience. This archetype blurs the lines between good and evil."

  "storyExcerpts": [
    "Freedom from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one's spirits—but when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern. \"Tell me!\" I said. \"I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.\"",
    "\"Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to what poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by events, but by me?\"",
    "\"Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.\"",
    "\"And how the blood lost or waste?\" I shook my head. He stepped over and sat down beside me, and went on:—",
    "\"You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold; but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to you. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men’s eyes, because they know—or think they know—some things which other men have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs, which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend to be young—like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor in astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in hypnotism——\"",
    "\"Yes,\" I said. \"Charcot has proved that pretty well.\" He smiled as he went on: \"Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then you understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great Charcot—alas that he is no more!—into the very soul of the patient that he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a blank? No? Then tell me—for I am student of the brain—how you accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, my friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered electricity—who would themselves not so long before have been burned as wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and ‘Old Parr’ one hundred and sixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men’s blood in her poor veins, could not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, we could have save her."
